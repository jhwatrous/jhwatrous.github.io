## About

I’m an educator and researcher specializing in quantum information and computation.

I did my graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin – Madison and a postdoctoral fellowship at l'Université de Montréal. I was then a faculty member at the University of Calgary for 7 years and the University of Waterloo for nearly 16 years, where I served as Interim Executive Director of the Institute for Quantum Computing during my final year as a professor. I then worked as Technical Director for Quantum Education at IBM for 3 1/2 years.

As an educator, my contributions include lecture notes for a few courses on quantum information and computation, a book on quantum information theory, and the course *Understanding Quantum Information and Computation* that I created while working for IBM. You can find these things by clicking on the <a href="{{ '/education.html' | relative_url }}">Education</a> tab.

As a researcher, I study the mathematics of quantum information and its connections to computation and information processing. Specific topics of interest include quantum complexity theory and quantum information theory. My papers are available by clicking on the <a href="{{ '/research.html' | relative_url }}">Research</a> tab.

From time to time I like to write about my experiences as a scientist and share ideas and an opinion or two. If you're interested, click on the <a href="{{ '/writings.html' | relative_url }}">Writings</a> tab.
