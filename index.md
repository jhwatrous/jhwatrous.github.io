# About

I’m an educator and researcher specializing in quantum information and computation. Here's a list of my prior positions and affiliations:

- University of Wisconsin – Madison. PhD in Computer Science, 1992–1998.
- Université de Montréal. Postdoctoral fellow, Département d'informatique et de recherche opérationnelle, 1998–1999.
- University of Calgary. Faculty member, Department of Computer Science, 1999–2006.
- University of Waterloo. Faculty member, School of Computer Science and Institute for Quantum Computing, 2006–2021. Interim Executive Director of the Institute for Quantum Computing, 2021.
- IBM. Distinguished Engineer and Technical Director for Quantum Education, 2022–2025.

As an educator, my contributions include lecture notes for a few courses on quantum information and computation, a book on quantum information theory, and the course *Understanding Quantum Information and Computation.* My research studies the mathematics of quantum information and its connections to computation and information processing. Specific topics I am interested include quantum complexity theory and quantum information theory. I also like to write about my experiences as a scientist and share ideas and an opinion or two from time to time.
