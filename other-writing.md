{% capture worst-TA %}

In my first semester as a graduate student, I taught introductory programming to around 25 undergraduates. This was just one of many, many sections of the same course. The hundreds of students enrolled were divvied up into small sections, and those sections were assigned to graduate student teaching assistants, many of whom (like me) had little or no teaching experience. I guess the reasoning was that if one section didn't go well, only a small fraction of students would be affected. There was a weekly session for first-time teaching assistants, to provide guidance, discuss the curriculum, and so on — but it obviously wasn't enough for me.

I performed abysmally. I didn't take it seriously and didn't particularly enjoy it — I wanted to be doing research instead. I remember uttering “I hate teaching” in class. Among other unforgivable transgressions, I provided an input set to a coding assignment that had a bug — I’d not even bothered to test it. How much frustration did that cause, I wonder?

I paid the price on the instructor evaluation at the end of the course, scoring at the very bottom of my entire department. I knew this because those scores were made public, including the names of the instructors. Everyone in my department would have looked at the bottom of the list and seen my name, like a car accident they weren't involved in. “John is the worst TA I’ve ever had,” one student wrote. I don’t know why, but those evaluations were a huge shock at the time. Somehow I hadn’t realized that I was so bad.

So I begged for another shot, and was offered an 8am class the next semester to make amends. I believe I did, at least to a new batch of students. I took it seriously, worked hard, and kept the perspective of the students in mind and treated them with respect. I doubled my evaluation scores — and I also found that I actually enjoyed teaching.

I think of this experience as being formative. When I was a professor, I put a lot of work into being a good instructor, and have no doubt that this experience was a part of what motivated that. I always tried to put myself in the shoes of my students and never asked them to do something I hadn't done myself to completion. I didn't hide the day before the final exam, I held "all day" office hours from 9 to 5 instead — those were unusually fun office hours in my memory. At some point I decided that would memorize the name of every student in my classes. I spent the hours proctoring exams by going from one student to the next in turn, reciting their names in my head. One year there was a student missing at the final exam, and although it took me a little while, I was able to figure out in my head who wasn't there. Anyway, the point is that I straightened myself out. I even received an award one year for outstanding teaching from my faculty — one of the few professional honors I've received and certainly the one that's most meaningful to me personally.

But I'll never get that first class back. And to those that took that class with me, all I can say is that I am truly sorry.

{% capture scooping %}

In science, getting *scooped* generally means that someone else announces a discovery, maybe by posting or publishing a paper, that steals the thunder from something you're working on. Maybe they reached the same conclusions as you but got there quicker — or maybe they discovered something more interesting that trivializes your work. Sometimes it's not so bad and you can still get something out of it, like quickly putting out a paper claiming an independent discovery, or perhaps publishing an alternative way to reach the same conclusion. Other times, there's nothing to be salvaged — so you ditch everything and move on to something else. This is a story about a time I was scooped as a graduate student that falls into the second category.

I'd been working on something for a while — several months at least. It had to do with space-bounded quantum computation, but the details aren't really important to the story. It was very technical, and I'd built up a lot of mathematical machinery to make it all work. I was nearly done with a paper about it, and I'd used the results I'd discovered as the basis for a thesis proposal that I had to submit and defend as a part of my PhD degree requirements. That part went fine and my thesis proposal was accepted.

A professor I worked with knew Peter Shor and had arranged for me to visit him for a couple of days. Peter was at AT&T Research at the time, before he moved to MIT. I prepared a talk on what I'd been working on and travelled to New Jersey. I was excited to share my results, and of course I also hoped to make a good impression. I got scammed by a limo driver on the way there, but that wasn't my main concern (and in the end I just claimed the expense and it was reimbursed).

About an hour or two before my talk, one of the postdocs working with Peter showed me a new paper he'd just learned about: *Reversible space equals deterministic space* by Lange, McKenzie, and Tapp. The title alone struck fear into my heart. I quickly read the paper, which is both simple and beautiful, and it probably took me about 90 seconds to understand how it worked. And I saw that it was a fatal headshot to my work. This wasn't a case where I could claim the independent discovery of something or salvage an alternative proof — everything I'd done was essentially trivialized by this work and no longer worth the paper I'd printed it on. It was pretty devastating, to be honest. As a graduate student, publishable results were few and far between and each felt precious. And this was more because it was going to be the basis of my thesis.

So that was bad — but then I had to give the talk. The reality was that what I'd come prepared to speak about was now trivial and pointless, and I was basically just wasting everyone's time. But I couldn't give the talk I'd prepared and not tell them what I'd recently learned, so I explained the situation and went through what I'd prepared. The audience was mercifully small, but it did include Peter. Eric Rains was there as well. Eric moved on to other subjects, but his work on quantum information theory from this period is well known and had a significant impact on the field. Anyway, it was a hard talk to give, and it surely did not impress, but at least it ended.

I have a memory of flying home, feeling defeated and shell shocked. But after I returned home, I just went back to work and started something new. I never again touched that nearly completed paper. Now, decades later, I no longer seem to have it in my files. And everything turned out fine. I found new results and wrote a different thesis than what I'd proposed — and if anyone on my committee realized, they didn't mention it. Of course, it also didn't matter what people thought of me, that wasn't the point of the visit.

I hope there's some encouragement to be found in this story. Looking back now, I wouldn't choose not to have had this experience. I learned from it and it made me stronger. We tend to hide our failures and struggles as we focus on our successes and accomplishments, but we're all subject to the luck of the draw — and things don't always go as we might have hoped. So if you face a setback you're not alone. To my eye the only thing to be done is to put one foot in front of the other and move forward.

{% capture advisors %}

When I was a graduate student my advisor was Eric Bach. He was a great advisor! He didn't work on quantum computing — very few people did back then — but I first learned about quantum computing through a reading group on it that Eric set up. He encouraged me to work on what I found to be interesting and gave me the freedom to do that. And though he didn't work on quantum computing specifically, he knew a hell of a lot about mathematics and computation, and I always knew more when I left his office than when I'd entered.

Some graduate students are not so lucky. In various roles I held as a professor, including being a graduate program director and the director of an institute, I sometimes interacted with students in distress over their advisor's treatment of them. Often they would cry. While I believe most professors I worked with treated their students kindly, some evidently did not.

I don't know why some professors treat their students the way they do. I suspect in some cases they're just trying to replicate the experience they had as a student, but they may not be able to do that. Or maybe the problem is that they are, in fact, able. Some professors drive hard and expect that from their students in return, and forget that their students aren't them. And some professors are just assholes.

In situations like this the power dynamic is completely imbalanced and students feel powerless. Switching to another advisor can be very difficult for multiple reasons, and there's always the fear that the student isn't going to be able to go anywhere without their advisor's letter of support. The perception is that this person that's making them miserable can end their career and everything they've worked for.

So what should you do if, as a student, you find yourself in this situation? I wish I had a good answer. My advice is to start by telling someone, like the program director for whatever degree program you're enrolled in, or maybe an associate chair or dean in charge of graduate studies. Nobody can help you if they don't know. Ask around — every program and department is different. Your department or school may have a graduate advocate or an ombudsperson with whom you can discuss the matter confidentially and can provide you with advice. Whatever happens, you don't need to put up with it — there are many paths your career can take and your advisor doesn't hold the keys to all of them.

And if you're you're deciding whom to work with as a graduate student, be sure to talk to people before making a decision. The right answer is not necessarily to go with the advisor or school with the bigger name. Talk to your would-be advisor and ask questions, and talk to their students as well. The importance of having an advisor that supports and encourages you, and has your best interests in mind, should never be underestimated.
