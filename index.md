# About

I’m an educator and researcher specializing in quantum information and computation, and currently serve as Director of Education and Training at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/">Institute for Quantum Computing</a> at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>. I was previously the Technical Director for Quantum Education at IBM, a faculty member at the University of Waterloo, and a faculty member at the University of Calgary. I obtained a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin – Madison and was a postdoctoral fellow at the Université de Montréal.

I created the course *Understanding Quantum Information and Computation,* authored the book *The Theory of Quantum Information,* and developed lecture notes for courses on quantum information and computation and the theory of computing. You can find these materials by clicking on <a href="{{ '/books-and-courses.html' | relative_url }}">Books and courses</a>.

My research studies the mathematics of quantum information and its connections to computation and information processing. Specific topics I am interested in include quantum complexity theory and quantum information theory.
