## About

I’m an educator and researcher specializing in quantum information and computation.

My interest in quantum computing began over 30 years ago in 1994, when I was a graduate student studying computational number theory at the University of Wisconsin – Madison. After reading Peter Shor's paper on efficient quantum algorithms for integer factorization and discrete logarithms, I was hooked — this was the coolest thing I'd ever seen in my life. So I completely dropped what I was doing and turned my focus to quantum information and computation, where it remains to this day.

After graduating with a PhD in 1998 I moved to Canada, initially for a one-year postdoctoral fellowship at l'Université de Montréal. I was then a faculty member at the University of Calgary for 7 years and then at the University of Waterloo for nearly 16 years, where I served as Interim Executive Director of the Institute for Quantum Computing for my final year as a professor. I left the University of Waterloo to join IBM at the start of 2021, where I worked as Technical Director for Quantum Education for 3 1/2 years. I left IBM in June of 2025, and the next stage of my career is yet to be determined.

As an educator, my contributions include lecture notes for a few courses on quantum information and computation, my book on quantum information theory, and the course *Understanding Quantum Information and Computation*, which I created while working for IBM. You can find these things by clicking on the Education tab above.

My primary interests as a researcher are in quantum complexity theory and quantum information theory. At a high level, I study the mathematics of quantum information and its connections to computation and information processing. Specific topics that interest me include modelling and describing computational interactions involving quantum information, such as quantum interactive proof systems and theoretical quantum cryptography, and connections between quantum information and other subjects including convex optimization and operator theory. My papers are available by clicking on the Research tab.

From time to time I like to write about my experiences as a scientist and, on occasion, share ideas and opinions. If you're interested, click on the Writings tab.
