I’m an educator and researcher specializing in quantum information and computation. Here are my prior positions and affiliations:

- University of Wisconsin – Madison. PhD in Computer Science, 1992–1998.
- Université de Montréal. Postdoctoral fellow, Département d'informatique et de recherche opérationnelle, 1998–1999.
- University of Calgary. Faculty member, Department of Computer Science, 1999–2006.
- University of Waterloo. Faculty member, School of Computer Science and Institute for Quantum Computing, 2006–2021. Interim Executive Director of the Institute for Quantum Computing, 2021.
- IBM. Distinguished Engineer and Technical Director for Quantum Education, 2022–2025.

As an educator, my contributions include the course *Understanding Quantum Information and Computation,* a book on quantum information theory, and lecture notes for a few courses on quantum information and computation and the theory of computing. You can find these materials by clicking on <a href="{{ '/books-and-courses.html' | relative_url }}">Books and courses</a>.

My research studies the mathematics of quantum information and its connections to computation and information processing. Specific topics I am interested include quantum complexity theory and quantum information theory. My papers are available from the <a href="{{ '/research-papers.html' | relative_url }}">Research papers</a> link.

I also like to write about my experiences as a scientist and share ideas and an opinion or two from time to time. If you're interested, click on <a href="{{ '/other-writing.html' | relative_url }}">Other writing</a>.
