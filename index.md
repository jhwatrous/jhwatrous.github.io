# About

I’m an educator and researcher specializing in quantum information and computation. Here's a list of my prior affiliations:

- University of Wisconsin – Madison, 1992–1998. PhD in Computer Science.
- Université de Montréal, 1998–1999. Postdoctoral Fellow.
- University of Calgary, 1999–2006. Faculty member, Department of Computer Science.
- University of Waterloo, 2006–2021. Faculty member, School of Computer Science and Institute for Quantum Computing.
- IBM, 2022–2025. Distinguished Engineer and Technical Director for Quantum Education.

As an educator, my contributions include lecture notes for a few courses on quantum information and computation, a book on quantum information theory, and the course *Understanding Quantum Information and Computation* that I created while working for IBM. You can find these things by clicking on the <a href="{{ '/education.html' | relative_url }}">Education</a> tab.

My research studies the mathematics of quantum information and its connections to computation and information processing. Specific topics of interest include quantum complexity theory and quantum information theory. My papers are available by clicking on the <a href="{{ '/research.html' | relative_url }}">Research</a> tab.

From time to time I like to write about my experiences as a scientist and share ideas and an opinion or two. If you're interested, click on the <a href="{{ '/writings.html' | relative_url }}">Writings</a> tab.
